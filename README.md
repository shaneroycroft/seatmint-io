## Core Features & User Stories

User stories are written in the standard format:  
**As a** [type of user], **I want** [some goal] **so that** [some reason].

### Event Organizers
- As an event organizer, I want to create an event with details (name, date, venue, description, ticket tiers) so that fans can discover and purchase tickets.
- As an event organizer, I want to define ticket supply, pricing, and metadata (including images/descriptions via CIP-68) so that tickets are minted as unique, updatable NFTs.
- As an event organizer, I want to set royalty percentages and resale price caps on secondary sales so that I receive ongoing revenue and prevent scalping.
- As an event organizer, I want to receive payouts automatically (primary sales + royalties) to my wallet so that I don't rely on intermediaries.
- As an event organizer, I want to validate ticket ownership on-site (via QR code or wallet signature) so that only legitimate holders gain entry.

### Ticket Buyers / Fans
- As a fan, I want to browse and discover upcoming events so that I can find interesting experiences.
- As a fan, I want to connect my Cardano wallet and purchase tickets with ADA (or stablecoins via partners) so that I own verifiable NFT tickets.
- As a fan, I want my ticket NFT to be visible in my wallet with rich metadata (art, event info) so that it doubles as a digital collectible.
- As a fan, I want to resell my ticket on a built-in or integrated marketplace with enforced rules (royalties, price caps) so that I can transfer ownership fairly.
- As a fan, I want access to exclusive perks (merch drops, meet & greets, community access) based on ticket ownership or history so that I feel rewarded for loyalty.

### Platform Admins / General
- As a platform user, I want secure authentication (wallet-based or Supabase email + wallet linking) so that my data and purchases are protected.
- As a developer/contributor, I want comprehensive Aiken unit & property tests for all validators so that smart contract behavior is verifiable.
- As anyone, I want full transparency of ticket ownership, transfers, and sales on-chain via Blockfrost explorers so that trust is built-in.
